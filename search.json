    "text": "Six months before the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm, I had the great fortune of a trio of entrepreneurs taking an interest in some unique diagnostic patents I had generated earlier in my career while at Monolythix. We had a shared vision to make diagnostics accessible to everyone and everywhere then built up a company, BiologyWorks, together with some of his friends. Suddenly, I found myself helping to get a business plan together, conducting market analysis, and convince others that we are worth their investment. We were successful in gaining funding and suddenly the pandemic took off but that was only the beginning. A whole journey ensued after in bringing up a laboratory, forming a team, developing a product, and then taking it to market.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{rueda2022,\n  author = {Ivan De Jesus Rueda},\n  title = {Building a Molecular Test for an Emerging Disease in a Global\n    Pandemic},\n  date = {2022-01-18},\n  url = {http://ivandrueda.github.io/projects/k(now) COVID-19 Molecular Test/k(now) COVID-19 Molecular Test.html},\n  langid = {en-US}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nIvan De Jesus Rueda. 2022. “Building a Molecular Test for an\nEmerging Disease in a Global Pandemic.” http://ivandrueda.github.io/projects/k(now)\nCOVID-19 Molecular Test/k(now) COVID-19 Molecular Test.html."
