Six months before the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm, I had the great fortune of
a trio of entrepreneurs taking an interest in some unique diagnostic patents I had generated earlier in
my career while at Monolythix. We had a shared vision to make diagnostics accessible to everyone and everywhere then built up a company, BiologyWorks, together with some of his friends. Suddenly, I found
myself helping to get a business plan together, conducting market analysis, and convince
others that we are worth their investment. We were successful in gaining funding and suddenly
the pandemic took off but that was only the beginning. A whole journey ensued after in
bringing up a laboratory, forming a team, developing a product, and then taking it to market.
